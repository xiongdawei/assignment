## Report

### Introduction
I used blender to create a simple laptop using the knowledge in computer science class about 3D visualization. The laptop computer is mainly of three component, the screen which is a squaure and the keyboard and the screen which are two cubic.

Then I set the light. There are two parellel light shed on the computer and a red point light right above the laptop computer. 

Then I configured the texture of these objects. I put the surface screen into the blue one and the keyboard into a black one. There are lots of option to modify the texture, including base color. subsurface color, metallic, specular, roughness, anisotropic, sheen tint, clearcoat roughness, alpha, IOR, transimission, transimiission roughness and so on. 

And then set the laptop computer with a certain motion so that it moves from one place to another. After rending, a 5seconds video is produced.
